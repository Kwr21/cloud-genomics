The cloud is a fancy name for the huge network of computers that host your favorite websites,
stream movies, and shop online, but you can also harness all of that computing power for
running analyses that would take days, weeks or even years on your local computer.

In this lesson, you'll learn about using cloud services that fit your analytic needs,
and how to interact with one of those services (SURFsara HPC) via the command line. 

SURFsara has been operating the HPC Cloud as an Infrastructure as a Service (`IaaS`) for several years. The HPC Cloud service offers users access to fast computing nodes and high-performant big storage volumes through a powerful graphical user interface. The underlying cluster [Oort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud) is managed by the [OpenNebula](http://opennebula.org/) cloud management software.

This tutorial aims to introduce the participants to the HPC Cloud, by providing a set of lectures and hands-on examples to be run on the _Oort_ infrastructure. If you follow these tutorials as part of an (introduction) course, your instructor will have credentials ready for you to use.
